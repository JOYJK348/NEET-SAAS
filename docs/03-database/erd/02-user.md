# 📌 Business Rules

- Every User must have at least one Role.
- Every Role must contain one or more Permissions.

# 💡 Design Principles

- User is the root identity entity.
- Platform Admin governs the SaaS platform.
- Tenant Admin governs institute operations.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) manages authorization.
- Login Sessions provide authentication tracking.
- Activity Logs provide auditability.
- Parent–Student association supports family relationships.
- User identity is independent of academic operations.
- Academic entities are referenced through cross-domain relationships.
- Cross-domain entities are intentionally excluded from this ERD.
